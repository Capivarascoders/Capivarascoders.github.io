Describes document validation market to help the income of people who work at home. The idea now is to enable the validation of personal documents where the validators are chosen by "Personas" (who wants to validate the information). The validators have scores raising their levels and attracting "personas" to choose from.

>Identity Money is a decentralized digital document validation solution that offers the user complete control of their data. Using Blockchain, decentralized, transparent and secure technology, Identity has its open source code, which can be integrated into different business models, according to the company's needs.
# How it works
The user can enter his information, send to validators that certify the veracity of the data, and thus share with websites, users, companies and other services that need his information. With Identity, the user has control over who accesses his data, being able to accept or not share certain information. It is possible to have access on several platforms, without the need to manage different users and passwords for each one.
# Ecosystem
Creates an ecosystem that allows users and validators to be rewarded for their information and service provision, respectively.
Formed by three actors:

- Persona - user who will input his Data to be validated

- Validator - user who will be responsible to validate the Data

- Consumer - external entities tha will consume the Persona's data
>The interaction between them can be monetized or not, varying according to the business model chosen by the entity that implements the solution.

# Process Steps
The persona creates your registration and chooses which validator will verify the veracity of your data;

The validator, after choosing the best business strategy for its service provision, returns the information's validity status to Persona;

The consumer defines what information he wants to access and sends a request for permission to Persona, which decides whether to allow the sharing of the information.
